## Local Development

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tapiwamla/NeXTSSH.git
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Add Environment Variables:
   Create a `.env` file with the following content:
   ```bash
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET='your-secret-key' # Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a secret key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL='your-production-url'
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID='your-client-id'
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET='your-client-secret'
   ```

   To get the GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET, follow these steps:
   - Go to GitHub Developer Settings:
     - Visit GitHub Developer Settings.
   - Create a New OAuth App:
     - Under the "OAuth Apps" section, click "New OAuth App".
   - Fill in the Application Details:
     - Application Name: Enter a name for your app (e.g., "Next.js App").
     - Homepage URL: Enter your application's URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000 for local development).
     - Authorization Callback URL: Enter the callback URL for your app. For NextAuth, this is typically:
       ```
       http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
       ```
   - Register the Application:
     - Click "Register Application".
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret:
     - After registering, you will see the Client ID on the app's page.
     - Click "Generate a new client secret" to get the Client Secret.

   **Note:** The `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` value is optional for development, but **required** for production.

4. Start the Development Server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   For production, first build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Then start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Testing
